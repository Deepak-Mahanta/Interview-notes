 ## Defination of Javascript?

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, high-level programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive web content. It is versatile, supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles, and runs in web browsers as well as on servers using environments like Node.js.

## what is a variable in JS ? 

A variable in JavaScript is a named container used to store data values. It allows you to reuse and manipulate data throughout your program. Variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`, with the latter two introduced in ES6 for block scoping and immutability, respectively. 


## Definition of Datatype? 

A data type in JavaScript refers to the kind of value a variable can hold or represent. It determines how the value is stored, manipulated, and interpreted in the program. JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

## what are truthi and falshi value ?

In JavaScript, truthy and falsy values determine how non-Boolean values are evaluated in Boolean contexts, such as conditionals (if, while, etc.).

## Defination of function 

A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. It can take inputs (parameters), process them, and return an output. Functions help in organizing, reusing, and managing code efficiently.

## Why Do We Need Conditions in JavaScript?

Conditions in JavaScript are used to make decisions in code based on certain criteria. They allow programs to perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false. This enables:

## Ternary Operator in JavaScript:
The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It has three parts:

A condition to evaluate.
The result if the condition is true.
The result if the condition is false.

## What is loop?

A loop in JavaScript is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks and allow the program to process collections of data, like arrays, without having to write the same code multiple times.


## Summary of Loop Types:
for loop: Best used when you know the number of iterations beforehand (e.g., for iterating through arrays).

while loop: Suitable when you donâ€™t know the number of iterations in advance, but the condition must hold true to continue looping.

do...while loop: Ensures the loop executes at least once, even if the condition is false.

for...in loop: Ideal for iterating over object properties.

for...of loop: Best for iterating over iterable collections like arrays or strings.

Each loop type has its ideal use case depending on the structure of the data and the condition you want to evaluate.


## Explain Scopes & Hoisting in JS?

Scope refers to the context in which variables, functions, and objects are accessible or visible. It determines where in the code you can access or modify these entities. JavaScript has three main types of scopes:

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means variables and functions can be used before they are declared.

## what is Closures in JS ?

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where a function retains access to its outer (enclosing) function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are created whenever a function is defined within another function, and the inner function "remembers" the variables from the outer function's scope.

## Defination of DOM ?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, allowing programs to interact with and manipulate the document's structure, style, and content dynamically.

## What is the meaning of "document" in DOM
The document object is the root of the DOM hierarchy and represents the entire HTML or XML document loaded in the browser. It acts as an entry point to access and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of the webpage.

## What is DOM manipulation?  
DOM manipulation refers to the process of dynamically changing the structure, content, or style of a webpage using JavaScript. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web experiences by modifying elements on the fly.

##  what is an  event in JS?  
An event in JavaScript represents an action or occurrence detected by the browser, such as a user interaction (click, hover, input), browser activity (loading, resizing), or other actions. Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behavior and dynamically update the DOM or perform tasks.

## What is an array ? 

An array is a data structure in JavaScript used to store multiple values in a single variable. These values, called elements, are indexed starting from 0. Arrays can hold any type of data, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.

## What is an Object? 

An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs where keys (also called properties) are strings or symbols, and values can be any data type, including other objects or functions. Objects are fundamental for structuring and organizing data in JavaScript.

## What is Type Conversion in JavaScript?
Type conversion in JavaScript refers to the process of converting one data type to another. JavaScript is a loosely-typed or dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any type. This often requires implicit or explicit type conversion between different data types.

There are two types of type conversion:

Implicit Type Conversion (Type Coercion)
Explicit Type Conversion


## What is Try-Catch and Error Handling in JavaScript?
Error handling in JavaScript is a mechanism to deal with runtime errors that may occur during the execution of the code. Errors can be handled using the try...catch statement, which allows you to test a block of code for errors and respond accordingly without stopping the execution of the program.

try...catch Statement
try block: Contains the code that might throw an error.
catch block: Contains the code that runs if an error is thrown inside the try block.

## What is Strict mode in JS?
Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript that helps you write cleaner and more secure code by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling. It prevents certain actions that are considered bad practices and can make your code more predictable, safer, and easier to debug.

Strict mode can be enabled by adding "use strict"; at the beginning of a script or function.


##  What is Timeout & Interval?

Both setTimeout() and setInterval() are JavaScript functions that allow you to schedule the execution of code after a specified amount of time. They are used to handle asynchronous operations, like delays or periodic actions.

## What is promises in JS?
In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

## Synchronous
Synchronous operations are those that run in sequence, meaning one task completes before the next one starts. This approach is straightforward but can be inefficient, especially for tasks that take a long time, such as file operations or network requests.

## Asynchronous
Asynchronous operations, on the other hand, allow multiple tasks to run concurrently, so the program can continue executing without waiting for an operation to complete. This is crucial for tasks like network requests, where waiting would be inefficient.

## Callback
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are essential in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations, such as API calls, timeouts, and event handling.

## Callback Hell 
it refers to a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain. This often occurs when asynchronous operations are performed in sequence, leading to deeply nested and convoluted code structures.

## IIFE  
An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It's a common design pattern used to create a private scope, preventing variables and functions from polluting the global scope.

```js

(function() {
  let message = "Hello, IIFE!";
  console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, IIFE!
})();
 
```
