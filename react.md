## What is react?

React is a JavaScript library that helps developers build user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. It's one of the most popular front-end libraries for web development.

## Key Differences between Framework and Library

A framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software applications. A library, on the other hand, is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks.

## What is an API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## what is state?

The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.It's a dynamic object that can change over time.

## what is useState?

In React, useState is a hook that allows you to add state variables to functional components. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it.

## What is hooks in reactjs?

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features and lifecycle methods in functional components.

## What is functional components in reactjs?

A functional component in React is a JavaScript function that returns JSX (JavaScript XML) JSX is similar to HTML, but has a unique syntax.

## What is class components components in reactjs?

A class component in React is a JavaScript class that renders React components.

## What is props in react js?

Props are used to pass data from one component to another.

## What is propsDrilling in react js?

Prop drilling in React is the process of passing properties (props) through multiple components to reach a deeply nested component.

## Explain the building blocks of React.

### The five main building blocks of React are

- Components: These are reusable blocks of code that return HTML.
- JSX: It stands for JavaScript and XML and allows you to write HTML in React.
- Props and State: props are like function parameters and State is similar to variables.
- Context: This allows data to be passed through components as props in a hierarchy.
- Virtual DOM: It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM which makes DOM manipulation easier.
  OR
  The Virtual DOM in React is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It helps React efficiently update and render the user interface by comparing the current and previous virtual DOM states using a process called diffing.

## What is a higher order components(HOC) in react js?

    A higher-order component (HOC) in React is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. The new component wraps the original component and may have additional properties or behaviors.

## Why we use ref in react ?

In React, refs are used to access and manipulate DOM nodes or React component instances directly, enabling actions like focusing an input, measuring an element's dimensions, or integrating with third-party DOM libraries.
