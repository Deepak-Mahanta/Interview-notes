Hello Sir/Mam,

I'm a recent graduate of Biju Patnaik University of Technology Rourkela, Odisha with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and I'm excited to apply for the ReactJS Developer position at Baseline IT Development. Although I'm new to the professional world, I'm eager to contribute my fresh perspective and recently acquired skills to your team.

During my internship at BWS as a Fullstack Development Intern, I worked with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. One of my notable projects included creating a clone of a popular game like Table Tennis. I also developed modern landing pages for a college website and built my personal portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

I'm particularly drawn to the innovative and collaborative environment at Baseline IT Development and am enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow with your organization.

I've attached my resume for your review and would be grateful for the chance to discuss how I can contribute to Baseline IT Development.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards, Deepak Kumar Mahanta
